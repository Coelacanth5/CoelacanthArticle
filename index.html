<strong>Coelacanth</strong>
<p>
The coelacanths (/ˈsiːləkænθ/ <i>SEE-lə-kanth</i>) constitute a now rare order of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fish">fish</a> that includes two extant species in the genus Latimeria: the West Indian Ocean coelacanth (Latimeria chalumnae) primarily found near the Comoro Islands off the east coast of Africa and the Indonesian coelacanth (Latimeria menadoensis).[2] They follow the oldest-known living lineage of Sarcopterygii (lobe-finned fish and tetrapods), which means they are more closely related to lungfish, reptiles, and mammals than to the common ray-finned fishes. They are found along the coastlines of the Indian Ocean and Indonesia.[3][4] Since there are only two species of coelacanth and both are threatened, it is the most endangered order of animals in the world. The West Indian Ocean coelacanth is a critically endangered species.

Coelacanths belong to the subclass Actinistia, a group of lobed-finned fish related to lungfish and certain extinct Devonian fish such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osteolepiformes">osteolepiforms</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Porolepiformes">porolepiforms</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhizodontida">rhizodonts</a>, and <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panderichthys">Panderichthys</a></i>.[5] Coelacanths were thought to have become extinct in the Late Cretaceous, around 66 million years ago, but were rediscovered in 1938 off the coast of South Africa.[6][7]

The coelacanth was long considered a "living fossil" because scientists thought it was the sole remaining member of a taxon otherwise known only from fossils, with no close relations alive,[5] and that it evolved into roughly its current form approximately 400 million years ago.[1] However, several recent studies have shown that coelacanth body shapes are much more diverse than previously thought.[8][9][10]

<strong>Etymology</strong>

<p>
The word <em>Coelacanth</em> is an adaptation of the Modern Latin Cœlacanthus ("hollow spine"), from the Greek κοῖλ-ος (koilos "hollow" + ἄκανθ-α akantha "spine"). It is a common name for the oldest living line of Sarcopterygii,[11] referring to the hollow caudal fin rays of the first fossil specimen described and named by Louis Agassiz in <time datetime="1839">1839</time>.[5] The genus name Latimeria commemorates Marjorie Courtenay-Latimer who discovered the first specimen in a fish market.[12]

<strong>General description</strong>
<p>
Latimeria chalumnae and L. menadoensis are the only two known living coelacanth species.[5][32] The word "coelacanth" is derived from the Greek for “hollow spine”, because of the fish's unique hollow spine fins.[28] Coelacanths are large, plump, lobe-finned fish that can grow to more than 2 <abbr title="meters" aria-label="meters">m</abbr> (6 <abbr title="feet" aria-label="feet">ft</abbr> 6 <abbr title="inches" aria-label="inches">in</abbr>) and weigh around 90 <abbr title="kilograms" aria-label="kilograms">kg</abbr> (200 <abbr title="pounds" aria-label="pounds">lbs</abbr>). They are estimated to live for 60 years or more.[33] Modern coelacanths appear larger than those found as fossils.[34]

They are nocturnal piscivorous drift-hunters.[35] The body is covered in cosmoid scales that act as armor.[36] Coelacanths have eight fins – 2 dorsal fins, 2 pectoral fins, 2 pelvic fins, 1 anal fin and 1 caudal fin. The tail is very nearly equally proportioned and is split by a terminal tuft of fin rays that make up its caudal lobe. The eyes of the coelacanth are very large, while the mouth is very small. The eye is acclimatized to seeing in poor light by rods that absorb mostly short wavelengths. Coelacanth vision has evolved to a mainly blue-shifted color capacity.[37] Pseudomaxillary folds surround the mouth and replace the maxilla, a structure absent in coelacanths. Two nostrils, along with four other external openings, appear between the premaxilla and lateral rostral bones. The nasal sacs resemble those of many other fish and do not contain an internal nostril. The coelacanth's rostral organ, contained within the ethmoid region of the braincase, has three unguarded openings into the environment and is used as a part of the coelacanth's laterosensory system.[5] The coelacanth's auditory reception is mediated by its inner ear, which is very similar to that of tetrapods because it is classified as being a basilar papilla.[38]

Coelacanth locomotion is unique. To move around they most commonly take advantage of up- or down-wellings of current and drift. Their paired fins stabilize movement through the water. While on the ocean floor, they do not use the paired fins for any kind of movement. Coelacanths create thrust with their caudal fins for quick starts. Due to the abundance of its fins, the coelacanth has high maneuverability and can orient its body in almost any direction in the water. They have been seen doing headstands as well as swimming belly up. It is thought that the rostral organ helps give the coelacanth electroperception, which aids in movement around obstacles.[35]
