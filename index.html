The coelacanths (/ˈsiːləkænθ/SEE-lə-kanth) constitute a now rare order of fish that includes two extant species in the genus Latimeria:
the West Indian Ocean coelacanth (Latimeria chalumnae) primarily found near the Comoro Islands off the east coast of Africa and the 
Indonesian coelacanth (Latimeria menadoensis).[2] They follow the oldest-known living lineage of Sarcopterygii 
(lobe-finned fish and tetrapods), which means they are more closely related to lungfish, reptiles, and mammals than to the common 
ray-finned fishes. They are found along the coastlines of the Indian Ocean and Indonesia.[3][4] Since there are only two species of 
coelacanth and both are threatened, it is the most endangered order of animals in the world. The West Indian Ocean coelacanth is a 
critically endangered species.

Coelacanths belong to the subclass Actinistia, a group of lobed-finned fish related to lungfish and certain extinct Devonian fish such 
as osteolepiforms, porolepiforms, rhizodonts, and Panderichthys.[5] Coelacanths were thought to have become extinct in the Late 
Cretaceous, around 66 million years ago, but were rediscovered in 1938 off the coast of South Africa.[6][7]

The coelacanth was long considered a "living fossil" because scientists thought it was the sole remaining member of a taxon otherwise 
known only from fossils, with no close relations alive,[5] and that it evolved into roughly its current form approximately 400 million 
years ago.[1] However, several recent studies have shown that coelacanth body shapes are much more diverse than previously 
thought.[8][9][10]
